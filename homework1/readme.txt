All "taqtrade***.txt" files are modified as required in problem3.

Problem2: 
Script file: hw1problem2.sh
The file, trading_files.txt, helps the shell script seize disered files from s3.
It generates 7 modified quote files as "taqtrade***.txt" and a file, "namefilelist", for problem3.

Problem3:
Script file: hw1problem3.sh
It uses the file "namefilelist" generated by hw1problem2.sh to get the file names after doing problem2.

Problem5:
Report file in txt format: problem5_report.txt
